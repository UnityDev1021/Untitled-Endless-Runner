=> Making Groups :
	(-) Fan Group :
		[=] Making group with block does not makes much sense as both are boost obstacles. So Fan before block makes no sense.
			[~] Can make the block group bigger, so the fan provides a boost to jump above the blocks.

=> Made Cartoon Wind Effect
	(-) Made 2 effects for horizontal wind that goes against the player with varying time
	(-) [Do] Make a function that detects whether the obstacle has any grouping or not. i.e. the obstacle is to be instantiated on top of each other or something like that.

=> Fans :
	(-) Applying effect for now on (fanForce / distance), can also use inverse square law (fanForce / distance * distance)
		[=] Also can use multiplier, to add on the effect of the fan, for as long as the player stays in the fan collider
	(-) [Do] It should be that the fan feels arcady-ish :
		[=] When the player moves in to the fan collider, the force should be the maximum
		[=] When the player jumps, is in the mid air and enters collider, then the player should experience a force where the player shoots above with the same or respective force, which launches the player to the same height as when the player enters the collider from the ground.
		[=] In both cases the jump limit should be capped to a specific height.
		
=> Trampoline :
	(-) Force multiplier is 20
	
=> Rock Head :
	(-) [Do] Rock head moves up slowly/ Slams back to the ground
	(-) Cannot use animation for the vertical up/down movement as the script also needs to manipulate the transform position.
	(-) Making child colliders as the colliders on the parent detects the player on every position.
