=> Making Groups :
	(-) Fan Group :
		[=] Making group with block does not makes much sense as both are boost obstacles. So Fan before block makes no sense.
			[~] Can make the block group bigger, so the fan provides a boost to jump above the blocks.
			
-------------------------------------------------------------------
							23 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Made Cartoon Wind Effect
	(-) Made 2 effects for horizontal wind that goes against the player with varying time
	(-) [Do] Make a function that detects whether the obstacle has any grouping or not. i.e. the obstacle is to be instantiated on top of each other or something like that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							24 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Decide whether it is good for animation or code to spawn different object groupings. i.e. on top of each other or something like that.
=> [Do] Making an entrance animation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							27 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] When the player jumps, the animations follows but the players shifts a bit forward, and then when the player lands, the player get back to his oroginal position.
=> Animation For Player Beta 1.0, done for now.

=> Fans :
	(-) Applying effect for now on (fanForce / distance), can also use inverse square law (fanForce / distance * distance)
		[=] Also can use multiplier, to add on the effect of the fan, for as long as the player stays in the fan collider
	(-) [Do] It should be that the fan feels arcady-ish :
		[=] When the player moves in to the fan collider, the force should be the maximum
		[=] When the player jumps, is in the mid air and enters collider, then the player should experience a force where the player shoots above with the same or respective force, which launches the player to the same height as when the player enters the collider from the ground.
		[=] In both cases the jump limit should be capped to a specific height.
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Fan stays on the ground and spins.
		
=> Trampoline :
	(-) Force multiplier is 20
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Goes up and down when the player steps on it.
	
=> Rock Head :
	(-) [Do] Rock head moves up slowly/ Slams back to the ground
	(-) [Alternative] Cannot use animation for the vertical up/down movement as the script also needs to manipulate the transform position.
	(-) Making child colliders as the colliders on the parent detects the player on every position.
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Single RockHead that goes up and down.
		[=] Duo that goes up and down in their original rotation.
		[=] Duo that goes up and down, while they are rotated 90.
		[=] Group of 4 goes up and down side by side.
		
=> Saw :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Saw goes up and down
		[=] Saw moves horizontally in to adn fro motion
		[=] Saw goes diagonally from top left to bottom right
		[=] Saw goes diagonally from top right to bottom left
		[=] Pair of 2 up and down, both moving horizontally in opp. directions
		[=] Pair of 2, both moving vertically in opp. directions
		
=> SpikedHead :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Same as RockHead, but with extra animations, such as going in vertical direction to and fro.
		
=> Spike :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Just stays on the ground.
		[=] Spikes will appear from the ground.
		
=> Fire :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Just stays on th ground and lights up in intervals
