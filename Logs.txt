													Game Instructions
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=> Always make sure that the currentHeart and totalHearts are the same in the MainGameplayUI and the GameLogic.
=> Using ObstacleSpawnerTest for now as it is easier. Can make improvements in the original Spawner script and use it if efficiency needed.
=> In Object Pooling, the objects are instantiated but, the start function will not be called as they are set to be inactive from the beginning. So need to call another function to propely set scripts references.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________


-------------------------------------------------------------------
							22nd March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Making Groups :
	(-) Fan Group :
		[=] Making group with block does not makes much sense as both are boost obstacles. So Fan before block makes no sense.
			[~] Can make the block group bigger, so the fan provides a boost to jump above the blocks.
			
-------------------------------------------------------------------
							23 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Made Cartoon Wind Effect
	(-) Made 2 effects for horizontal wind that goes against the player with varying time
	(-) [Do] Make a function that detects whether the obstacle has any grouping or not. i.e. the obstacle is to be instantiated on top of each other or something like that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							24 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Decide whether it is good for animation or code to spawn different object groupings. i.e. on top of each other or something like that.
=> [Do] Making an entrance animation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							27 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] When the player jumps, the animations follows but the players shifts a bit forward, and then when the player lands, the player get back to his oroginal position.
=> Animation For Player Beta 1.0, done for now.
=> [Do] When the player slides, the player should accelerate for a moment but slows down after reaching a distance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							28 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Make Swipe Controls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							30 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------

=> By default, total hearts will be 4
=> Heart mechanism done for now.
=> [Done For Now] Making trampoline mechanics work.
=> [Working] Working on Ending the Game.
=> [Do] Remove damage variable from Obstacles.
=> Increasing Collider Trigger of trampoline as the player sometimes goes through the trigger and the veocity applied goes negative. [Didn't Work] (Not Enough Force to Pull Player up, instead player goes through)
=> Attaching Collider beneath the trampoline so as the player does not go through.
=> Fixing Double Jump. Triple Jump does not work if the player enters fan/trampoline, the player can only jump once again when they enter the obstacle.
=> [Working] Making Fire Group
=> Fixed Fire Animation Colider Trigger
=> [Done For Now] Made Player UnAlive animation.
=> Making SpikeHead the same as RockHead.
=> [Do] Fix SpikeHead. The player unalives as soon as the player touches the spikes. The player will unalive only when the player is beneath it.
=> [Working] Making RockHead appear on different vertical positions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							31 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For Now] RockHead spawns at different positions. Lerp works good for now.
=> [Do] Make something to make the player that health has gone. i.e. Screen Shake, sound, screen goes red for a moment, blood appears on the sides of the window.
=> [Working] Making obstacles combo so 2 or more obstacle can be sued as one. Would have to make separate scripts for them.
=> Fixing Sprites
=> Making Code to instantiate complex groups.
=> The helper functions of OnEnable and OnDisable might cause Race consitions in current state if invoke with 0f value.
=> Made Air animation coming out of the fan.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							3 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> So the Spike Head was not moving properly, as the Assigning func was being called before the start, so the tempPos was being reset as soon as the obstacle was being activated. If the obstacle is not activated at the time of instantiation, then the Start func will never be called on time, and only after setActive has been called.
=> [Working] Determine time required to go up at the same speed, via controlling time. As when the spikeHead is instantiated, it will go slow, as the time required is 1 sec.
	(-) Wrong, doing speed Multiplier.
	(-) Setting Positions and speed multiplier in AssignGroupTypes under Heads
	(-) Done For Now
=> [Working] Making Saw mechanics to go up/down

		[=] grass :- (0x, 0.39y, 0z)
		[=] ground :- (0x, 0.39y, 0z)
	(-) [Done For Now] Reset every child of the parent when doing reset.
	(-) [Done] Moved Invoke call of Spawn method to OnEnable func.
=> Fixed Slide mechanic where the player does not seem to slide in succession as the environment keeps stable. Now there is some cooldown time for the slide mechanism.
=> Obstacle does not spawn correctly.

=> [Do] Make Other Obstacle Combinations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							11 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For Now] Fixing Fire Obstacle where player dies if entering 2nd time for long.
=> Made a Test macro for testing as fast as possible??
=> [Fixed] Effects are not enabled again once the player unalives.
=> PlayerController is disabled previously, so unAlive was not being set false. Now, moved it to PlayAnimation.

=> [Question] If a obstacle breaks such as RockHead, is the player able to do double jump or single jump?
=> [Question] If spikes cause half a heart, then why does the SpikeHead immediately unalives the player on touch. Shouldn't the player unalive only when the player is beneath the SpikeHead?

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							12 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Fixed] Sliding still has problems
	(-) When the Slide happens once, the time of BAckground Controller hasn't gone up to full 1, and when someone presses the slide button again, the move Speed gets adjusted according to the time variable which in case gives a value like 0.1089896, this continues for the set period for which the player has to slide and so the player slide speed is not set to the default of 0.2.
	(-) [Done] Set the invoke time of SlideOn to 1.5f instead of 1.25, as it needs to include the full animation of (Slide + the offset of slowing down).
	(-) Remade the logic so that there is a callback to indicate that the slide is to be finished and so the slide button should be enabled back again.

	(-) The Scarf color changes and gradually goes away from left to right.
	(-) Make Dash Animation.
	(-) Dash Icon with circle Outside, the dash icon gradually fades away from right to left.

		[=] Added a status variable to check which status the action is to be done to. i.e. it is to be active or disabled.
=> [Working] [Power-Up] Higher Jump
	(-) Icon Changes to higher jump.
	(-) Icon gradually drains away from top to bottom
=> [Working] [Power-Up] Faster Speed
	(-) This will be Visual, so Might not need any icon or so.
=> [Fixed] Jump Mechanics
	(-) OnTriggerEnter2D of the player gets executed onc the player takes off from the ground as the player is still touching the ground, and as soon as the player takes off, the disableSlide is turned to false.				//Yeah thats expected/intended (more on the intended side)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							13 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For Now] [Power-Up] Higher Jump
	(-) Making Controller For Higher Jump.
	(-) [Important] Declaring to inrease the jumpForce explicitly instead of using a variable.

			{~} Check Half Heart 
				(+) If true, then fill the next heart with half heart and current heart with full heart.
				(+) If false, then fill the next heart with full heart.
	(-) If the total heart is less than the heart container
		[=] Same as above but not adding a new heart.
	(-) [Suggestion] On getting PowerUp, the hearts gained will go away once they are used up. Only 4 hearts will be present. i.e. if the player has 5 hearts and uses their 5th heart, then the susequent heart will fade away and only 4 heart will remain. But if the player uses their 4th heart, it will just become empty.
=> [Working] Buy Power-Ups at the Main Menu.

		[=] Instead of using IEnumerator, just enabling and disabling the red panel.
	(-) Flashing Screen Red multiple times might not be a good idea.
	(-) Making the player flsah red for a certain amount of time to indicate that the player has taken damage.
=> [Done For Now] Showing Total coins collected during the run on the game over panel.

=> Change Moon To Sun
=> Sound Manager will have 2 Audio Sources. The First will be for the "click" sounds or "player buttons" sounds.
	(-) As one of the two, would be playing at a time. So can use the first one in this way.
	
=> Music :-
	(-) Music for Arcade Style Game - Music by lucadialessandro from Pixabay
	(-) On The Road To The Eighties - Music by Grand_Project from Pixabay
	(-) Play Again - Classic Arcade Game - Music by Dream-Protocol from Pixabay
	(-) Item Check - Video Game Theme - Music by GiriIS from Pixabay
	(-) Arcade Room - Music by jimgor33 from Pixabay
	
=> [Fixed] Powers were not being activated.
	(-) Instead of having a separate callback for Invoking powers at the start. Using the same callback of OnPowerUpCollected to invoke start powers.
	
=> [SFX] (Working) Making script to play sound effects for player action.
	(-) Having callback OnPlayerAction for playing sound effects when any action button is pressed.
		[=] Can't place Sound effects on button as when the button is pressed multiple times, that many times the sound effect is played.
		[=] [Not Required] Having OnPlayerAction for hit obstacles on obstacles. Already have this on PlayerController.
	(-) BGM loops back on itself with an Invoke function.
	(-) [Fixed] Some Effects can cancel out each other if played simultaneously, such as, if Speed Boost is collected and jump is clicked.
		[=] Using PlayOneShot instead of Play to overlap sound effects. Works properly for now.

=> Changing to Day in BackGround.
=> [Fixed For Now] after unalive, the player still goes up from fan. the player does jump animation.
	(-) Maybe the obstacles don't realize that the player is unalive.
	(-) Added the gameStarted bool check on baseObstacleController to only ApplyEffect when it is true.
=> [Bug] Sliding disables the trampoline.
=> [Fixed For Now] Sliding above fan/ maybe trampoline doubles the jump height.
	(-) Was calling mobile_jump but now manually defining what to do instead of calling the function. The function was adding extra velocity to the player.
=> [Bug] SpikedHead is detected but pushes the player to the ground and the player lives.
=> [Fixed For Now] Spawn reset not working properly.
	(-) gameStarted was being toggle after OnPlayerHEalthOver in PlayerController, so moved it beneath.
=> [Bug] After Sliding into Fan, and coming down to ground, the player dows not slide for a certain time.
	(-) ClearEffects was being called at OnTriggerExit2D, so the effects were being cleared as soon as the player exited and then again being triggered as the effects were cleared.
	(-) The player does a triple jump, if the player encounters a boost obstacle such as fan or trampoline, then the player could a triple jump. This rarely happens but if the player hits the jump button on a set time, then this could occur. When the player leaves the ground, the "Reset Trigger" is hit, which resets the jumpCount to 0, thus enabling the player to basically do a triple jump.		//Fun Mechanic, gonna leave this here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							21 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Fixed] Fire Controller working properly now.
	(-) Added the invincibility check.
=> [BG Anim] 11029 - 12229

		[=] Initial orthographic size is 1.7f and the final is the calculated size.
=> [Do] Show Diamonds on the "Buy hearts Panel".
=> Added extra sprites in order to adjust to Screen Resolution changes.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=> Fans :
	(-) Applying effect for now on (fanForce / distance), can also use inverse square law (fanForce / distance * distance)
		[=] Also can use multiplier, to add on the effect of the fan, for as long as the player stays in the fan collider
	(-) [Do] It should be that the fan feels arcady-ish :
		[=] When the player moves in to the fan collider, the force should be the maximum
		[=] When the player jumps, is in the mid air and enters collider, then the player should experience a force where the player shoots above with the same or respective force, which launches the player to the same height as when the player enters the collider from the ground.
		[=] In both cases the jump limit should be capped to a specific height.
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Fan stays on the ground and spins.
		
=> Trampoline :
	(-) Force multiplier is 20
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Goes up and down when the player steps on it.
	
=> Rock Head :
	(-) [Do] Rock head moves up slowly/ Slams back to the ground
	(-) [Alternative] Cannot use animation for the vertical up/down movement as the script also needs to manipulate the transform position.
	(-) Making child colliders as the colliders on the parent detects the player on every position.
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Single RockHead that goes up and down.
		[=] Duo that goes up and down in their original rotation.
		[=] Duo that goes up and down, while they are rotated 90.
		[=] Group of 4 goes up and down side by side.

=> Spike :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Just stays on the ground.
		[=] Spikes will appear from the ground.
		
=> Fire :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Just stays on th ground and lights up in intervals
		[=] Might also light up in random intervals.

													Spawn Combinations
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=> Can Spawn spike with rockhead at a smaller distance such as 2 for harder difficulties.
	[-] Spawning at more than 2 (i.e. 3) for now. The player will land directly on the spike if they dont jump at the correct distance.
	
	=> There is a Ninja, whose name shall remain Untitled, who is running endlessly from the world trying to undo the fate cursed upon him. Will the Ninja be able to turn destiny around and face the hardships that lie ahead on this path, or will he succumb to the endless void of nothingness reduced to figments of his forgotten past? Stay tuned and Play the game to find out about the path our Ninja friend takes.
