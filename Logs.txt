													Game Instructions
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=> Always make sure that the currentHeart and totalHearts are the same in the MainGameplayUI and the GameLogic.
=> Using ObstacleSpawnerTest for now as it is easier. Can make improvements in the original Spawner script and use it if efficiency needed.
=> In Object Pooling, the objects are instantiated but, the start function will not be called as they are set to be inactive from the beginning. So need to call another function to propely set scripts references.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________


-------------------------------------------------------------------
							22nd March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Making Groups :
	(-) Fan Group :
		[=] Making group with block does not makes much sense as both are boost obstacles. So Fan before block makes no sense.
			[~] Can make the block group bigger, so the fan provides a boost to jump above the blocks.
			
-------------------------------------------------------------------
							23 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Made Cartoon Wind Effect
	(-) Made 2 effects for horizontal wind that goes against the player with varying time
	(-) [Do] Make a function that detects whether the obstacle has any grouping or not. i.e. the obstacle is to be instantiated on top of each other or something like that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							24 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Decide whether it is good for animation or code to spawn different object groupings. i.e. on top of each other or something like that.
=> [Do] Making an entrance animation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							27 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] When the player jumps, the animations follows but the players shifts a bit forward, and then when the player lands, the player get back to his oroginal position.
=> Animation For Player Beta 1.0, done for now.
=> [Do] When the player slides, the player should accelerate for a moment but slows down after reaching a distance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							28 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Make Swipe Controls.
=> Making The Collider of player as non trigger, and relying on triggers on obstacle to detect the player.
=> [Do] Make better double jumps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							29 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For now] Making hearts for health.
=> [Done For now] Make Damage Mechanism
=> [Working] Make Boost Mechanism

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							30 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Each Obstacle will deal the same amount of damage. i.e. (-0.5) for half a heart
=> By default, total hearts will be 4
=> Heart mechanism done for now.
=> [Done For Now] Making trampoline mechanics work.
=> [Working] Working on Ending the Game.
=> [Do] Remove damage variable from Obstacles.
=> Increasing Collider Trigger of trampoline as the player sometimes goes through the trigger and the veocity applied goes negative. [Didn't Work] (Not Enough Force to Pull Player up, instead player goes through)
=> Attaching Collider beneath the trampoline so as the player does not go through.
=> Fixing Double Jump. Triple Jump does not work if the player enters fan/trampoline, the player can only jump once again when they enter the obstacle.
=> [Working] Making Fire Group
=> Fixed Fire Animation Colider Trigger
=> [Done For Now] Made Player UnAlive animation.
=> Making SpikeHead the same as RockHead.
=> [Do] Fix SpikeHead. The player unalives as soon as the player touches the spikes. The player will unalive only when the player is beneath it.
=> [Working] Making RockHead appear on different vertical positions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							31 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For Now] RockHead spawns at different positions. Lerp works good for now.
=> [Do] Make something to make the player that health has gone. i.e. Screen Shake, sound, screen goes red for a moment, blood appears on the sides of the window.
=> [Working] Making obstacles combo so 2 or more obstacle can be sued as one. Would have to make separate scripts for them.
=> Fixing Sprites
=> Making Code to instantiate complex groups.
=> The helper functions of OnEnable and OnDisable might cause Race consitions in current state if invoke with 0f value.
=> Made Air animation coming out of the fan.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							3 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> So the Spike Head was not moving properly, as the Assigning func was being called before the start, so the tempPos was being reset as soon as the obstacle was being activated. If the obstacle is not activated at the time of instantiation, then the Start func will never be called on time, and only after setActive has been called.
=> [Working] Determine time required to go up at the same speed, via controlling time. As when the spikeHead is instantiated, it will go slow, as the time required is 1 sec.
	(-) Wrong, doing speed Multiplier.
	(-) Setting Positions and speed multiplier in AssignGroupTypes under Heads
	(-) Done For Now
=> [Working] Making Saw mechanics to go up/down
	(-) Saw speed will be same all the way up or down.
=> [Working] Making MetalPlate mechanics

=> [Working] Making Horizontal controls for Heads.
=> [Do] Make a base controller for Head as both the SpikeHead and RockHead are the same.
=> [Working] Fixing Obstacle Controllers to have 0 as group type as the start is called after and thus ruins stuff.
=> [Working] Making the character slide.
	(-) Disable Jump if slide
	(-) If the player has pressed jump, the player will not slide
	(-) Made Logic
	(-) [Do] Make Animation
=> Made Animation for Double Jump
=> [Working] Making Day/Night Cycle Animation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							5 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [working] Night To Day Transition
=> [Working] Making Tap To Play Mechanism
=> Player Entry Pos - (-8.43x, -2.3y)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							6 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Made Exit Button/Mechanism for now.
=> [Working] Making FadeIn/FadeOut Transition
	(-) Made the transition.
	(-) [Working] Making mechanism so that everything is reset before the FadeOut plays.
=> [Working] Making Slide mechanism without manipulating the velocity of the player, instead increasing the camera speed for parallax.
=> Fixed Double Jump For Now.
	(-) Changed the counter to 1 as the player is standing on the ground so when the player jumps, it gets reset to 1
=> [Do] Fix Reset so that the obstacle spawner works when reset.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							7 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Working] Making Reset Mechanism
	(-) Prop Positions :-
		[=] sun_moon :- (0x, -6y, 0z)
		[=] clouds :- (0x, -0.5y, 0z)
		[=] clouds-b :- (0x, 0y, 0z)

		[=] foreground-tree :- (0x, 1.23y, 0z)
		[=] grass :- (0x, 0.39y, 0z)
		[=] ground :- (0x, 0.39y, 0z)
	(-) [Done For Now] Reset every child of the parent when doing reset.
	(-) [Done] Moved Invoke call of Spawn method to OnEnable func.
=> Fixed Slide mechanic where the player does not seem to slide in succession as the environment keeps stable. Now there is some cooldown time for the slide mechanism.
=> Obstacle does not spawn correctly.
=> Fixed the Spawn Code where the timing went off after pausing the game. Calculating the time difference, between the time of invoke of the spawn method and the time where the pause button was clicked.
=> Made Coin Animation along with the colliders for every frame.
	(-) Updating Colliders
=> [Done For Now] Made mobile controls.
	(-) Made some helper functions to detect that the button has been pressed and a temporary variable for the toggle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							10 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For Now] Made Coin Collection mechanism for now.
=> Made a macro to define if working on Mobile Controls or Testing on PC
=> [Working] Making Entry Animation
	(-) 20 sec difference
	(-) Made a different Camera as the Main Camera has all the background as its children, so the Entry Camera will handle all the entry animations.
	(-) Modified the Entry Script so that the EnablePortal, EnablePlayer does not gets called. Make different function to enable other objects.
=> Made a UI and a callback to show that the coin has been collected by the player.
=> Made the Internal Testing/ Closed Testing.
=> [Do] Check RockHead collision as the player dies as soon as they touch the base of the obstacle.
=> [Done For Now] Correct Fire Obstacle.
=> Fixed the ObstacleSpawner not working properly after Reset
	(-) The spawnEnabled was being called twice for restart so made a bool to check if gameplay has ended.
=> [Do] [Not needed] The player unalives if the player stays in the fire for too long for the 2nd time of the same obstacle.
	(-) Bruh, there's the capture collider due to which the player unalives and not the fire. 			//Really?
=> [Do] Make Other Obstacle Combinations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							11 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For Now] Fixing Fire Obstacle where player dies if entering 2nd time for long.
=> Made a Test macro for testing as fast as possible??
=> [Fixed] Effects are not enabled again once the player unalives.
=> PlayerController is disabled previously, so unAlive was not being set false. Now, moved it to PlayAnimation.
=> [Fixed] RockHead unalives player when it goes down only, as the previous mechanism was reversed.
=> [Working] Making Power-Ups
	(-) [Done For Now] RockHead gets crushed into pieces when it touches the player/falls apart
		[=] RockHead does not crushes the player.
	(-) The same goes for SpikedHead
=> [Do] Make a single script for powerups.
=> [Working] [Power-Up] Making Shield Animation
	(-) Added Sprite for Shield.
	(-) Added Controller Script.
	(-) Added Edge Collider with trigger to detect which collider is touching player when gained power-up.
	(-) [Do] Make a Visual Power-Up for player.
	(-) [Done For Now] Shield Collection.
	(-) [Working] Make a timer for this.
=> Added another callback for Power-Ups.
=> [Done For Now] Make destruction for SpikedHead, the same as RockHead.
	(-) Can add a small patform for the player to stand on, at the edges of the spike.
	(-) [Done For Now] [Works] Might turn Box Collider to edge collider for player detection
=> [Question] If a obstacle breaks such as RockHead, is the player able to do double jump or single jump?
=> [Question] If spikes cause half a heart, then why does the SpikeHead immediately unalives the player on touch. Shouldn't the player unalive only when the player is beneath the SpikeHead?

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							12 April
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Fixed] Sliding still has problems
	(-) When the Slide happens once, the time of BAckground Controller hasn't gone up to full 1, and when someone presses the slide button again, the move Speed gets adjusted according to the time variable which in case gives a value like 0.1089896, this continues for the set period for which the player has to slide and so the player slide speed is not set to the default of 0.2.
	(-) [Done] Set the invoke time of SlideOn to 1.5f instead of 1.25, as it needs to include the full animation of (Slide + the offset of slowing down).
	(-) Remade the logic so that there is a callback to indicate that the slide is to be finished and so the slide button should be enabled back again.
=> Changed Action Timer from 1.0f to 0.8f in the BackGroundController script.
=> [Suggestion] Can make a radial coutdown like timer to show the refill of jump or slide.
=> [Done For Now] Making Shield de-activate after timer is up.
	(-) [Fixed] Shield timer is not working properly after collecting once again.
		[=] [Done] Assigned a Coroutine reference to stop, if it is called once again.
	(-) [Fixed] Reset Invincibility, Reset Mechanism does not works properly.

=> [Do] [Power-Up] Power-Up to dash on the air.
=> [Done For Now] Make High Score System locally.
	(-) Saving High Score locally for now.
=> [Done For Now] [Power-Up] Making Double Score Power-Up
	(-) Making a single IEnumerator to call when the power-up is activated in MainGameplayUI.
	(-) Made Controller for the Score2x.
	(-) Assigning Basic Animation/colliders
	(-) score gets +1 in case the multiplier is collected, for now, as the default score raises by 1 for the movement of the camera.
=> [Done For Now] [Power-Up] Air Dash / Dash
	(-) The Scarf color changes and gradually goes away from left to right.
	(-) Make Dash Animation.
	(-) Dash Icon with circle Outside, the dash icon gradually fades away from right to left.
	(-) making Dash Logic.
	(-) Made a different action to identify that the player has taken an action
	(-) Made an enum for player actions.
	(-) [Done] Better to make different function to call when the action is to be enabled again.
		[=] Added a status variable to check which status the action is to be done to. i.e. it is to be active or disabled.
=> [Working] [Power-Up] Higher Jump
	(-) Icon Changes to higher jump.
	(-) Icon gradually drains away from top to bottom
=> [Working] [Power-Up] Faster Speed
	(-) This will be Visual, so Might not need any icon or so.
=> [Fixed] Jump Mechanics
	(-) OnTriggerEnter2D of the player gets executed onc the player takes off from the ground as the player is still touching the ground, and as soon as the player takes off, the disableSlide is turned to false.				//Yeah thats expected/intended (more on the intended side)

=> Fans :
	(-) Applying effect for now on (fanForce / distance), can also use inverse square law (fanForce / distance * distance)
		[=] Also can use multiplier, to add on the effect of the fan, for as long as the player stays in the fan collider
	(-) [Do] It should be that the fan feels arcady-ish :
		[=] When the player moves in to the fan collider, the force should be the maximum
		[=] When the player jumps, is in the mid air and enters collider, then the player should experience a force where the player shoots above with the same or respective force, which launches the player to the same height as when the player enters the collider from the ground.
		[=] In both cases the jump limit should be capped to a specific height.
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Fan stays on the ground and spins.
		
=> Trampoline :
	(-) Force multiplier is 20
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Goes up and down when the player steps on it.
	
=> Rock Head :
	(-) [Do] Rock head moves up slowly/ Slams back to the ground
	(-) [Alternative] Cannot use animation for the vertical up/down movement as the script also needs to manipulate the transform position.
	(-) Making child colliders as the colliders on the parent detects the player on every position.
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Single RockHead that goes up and down.
		[=] Duo that goes up and down in their original rotation.
		[=] Duo that goes up and down, while they are rotated 90.
		[=] Group of 4 goes up and down side by side.
		
=> Saw :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Saw goes up and down
		[=] Saw moves horizontally in to adn fro motion
		[=] Saw goes diagonally from top left to bottom right
		[=] Saw goes diagonally from top right to bottom left
		[=] Pair of 2 up and down, both moving horizontally in opp. directions
		[=] Pair of 2, both moving vertically in opp. directions
		
=> SpikedHead :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Same as RockHead, but with extra animations, such as going in vertical direction to and fro.
		
=> Spike :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Just stays on the ground.
		[=] Spikes will appear from the ground.
		
=> Fire :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Just stays on th ground and lights up in intervals
		[=] Might also light up in random intervals.
		
=> SpikedBall :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Moves in an arc in to and fro motion.

													Spawn Combinations
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=> Can Spawn spike with rockhead at a smaller distance such as 2 for harder difficulties.
	[-] Spawning at more than 2 (i.e. 3) for now. The player will land directly on the spike if they dont jump at the correct distance.
	
	=> There is a Ninja, whose name shall remain Untitled, who is running endlessly from the world trying to undo the fate cursed upon him. Will the Ninja be able to turn destiny around and face the hardships that lie ahead on this path, or will he succumb to the endless void of nothingness reduced to figments of his forgotten past?
