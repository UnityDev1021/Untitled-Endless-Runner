													Game Instructions
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=> Always make sure that the currentHeart and totalHearts are the same in the MainGameplayUI and the GameLogic.
=> Using ObstacleSpawnerTest for now as it is easier. Can make improvements in the original Spawner script and use it if efficiency needed.
=> In Object Pooling, the objects are instantiated but, the start function will not be called as they are set to be inactive from the beginning. So need to call another function to propely set scripts references.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							22nd March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Making Groups :
	(-) Fan Group :
		[=] Making group with block does not makes much sense as both are boost obstacles. So Fan before block makes no sense.
			[~] Can make the block group bigger, so the fan provides a boost to jump above the blocks.
			
-------------------------------------------------------------------
							23 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Made Cartoon Wind Effect
	(-) Made 2 effects for horizontal wind that goes against the player with varying time
	(-) [Do] Make a function that detects whether the obstacle has any grouping or not. i.e. the obstacle is to be instantiated on top of each other or something like that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							24 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Decide whether it is good for animation or code to spawn different object groupings. i.e. on top of each other or something like that.
=> [Do] Making an entrance animation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							27 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] When the player jumps, the animations follows but the players shifts a bit forward, and then when the player lands, the player get back to his oroginal position.
=> Animation For Player Beta 1.0, done for now.
=> [Do] When the player slides, the player should accelerate for a moment but slows down after reaching a distance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							28 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Make Swipe Controls.
=> Making The Collider of player as non trigger, and relying on triggers on obstacle to detect the player.
=> [Do] Make better double jumps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							29 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For now] Making hearts for health.
=> [Done For now] Make Damage Mechanism
=> [Working] Make Boost Mechanism

-------------------------------------------------------------------
							30 March
-------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Each Obstacle will deal the same amount of damage. i.e. (-0.5) for half a heart
=> By default, total hearts will be 4
=> Heart mechanism done for now.
=> [Done For Now] Making trampoline mechanics work.
=> [Working] Working on Ending the Game.
=> [Do] Remove damage variable from Obstacles.
=> Increasing Collider Trigger of trampoline as the player sometimes goes through the trigger and the veocity applied goes negative. [Didn't Work] (Not Enough Force to Pull Player up, instead player goes through)
=> Attaching Collider beneath the trampoline so as the player does not go through.
=> Fixing Double Jump. Triple Jump does not work if the player enters fan/trampoline, the player can only jump once again when they enter the obstacle.
=> [Working] Making Fire Group
=> Fixed Fire Animation Colider Trigger
=> [Done For Now] Made Player UnAlive animation.
=> Making SpikeHead the same as RockHead.
=> [Do] Fix SpikeHead. The player unalives as soon as the player touches the spikes. The player will unalive only when the player is beneath it.
=> [Working] Making RockHead appear on different vertical positions.

=> Fans :
	(-) Applying effect for now on (fanForce / distance), can also use inverse square law (fanForce / distance * distance)
		[=] Also can use multiplier, to add on the effect of the fan, for as long as the player stays in the fan collider
	(-) [Do] It should be that the fan feels arcady-ish :
		[=] When the player moves in to the fan collider, the force should be the maximum
		[=] When the player jumps, is in the mid air and enters collider, then the player should experience a force where the player shoots above with the same or respective force, which launches the player to the same height as when the player enters the collider from the ground.
		[=] In both cases the jump limit should be capped to a specific height.
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Fan stays on the ground and spins.
		
=> Trampoline :
	(-) Force multiplier is 20
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Goes up and down when the player steps on it.
	
=> Rock Head :
	(-) [Do] Rock head moves up slowly/ Slams back to the ground
	(-) [Alternative] Cannot use animation for the vertical up/down movement as the script also needs to manipulate the transform position.
	(-) Making child colliders as the colliders on the parent detects the player on every position.
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Single RockHead that goes up and down.
		[=] Duo that goes up and down in their original rotation.
		[=] Duo that goes up and down, while they are rotated 90.
		[=] Group of 4 goes up and down side by side.
		
=> Saw :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Saw goes up and down
		[=] Saw moves horizontally in to adn fro motion
		[=] Saw goes diagonally from top left to bottom right
		[=] Saw goes diagonally from top right to bottom left
		[=] Pair of 2 up and down, both moving horizontally in opp. directions
		[=] Pair of 2, both moving vertically in opp. directions
		
=> SpikedHead :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Same as RockHead, but with extra animations, such as going in vertical direction to and fro.
		
=> Spike :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Just stays on the ground.
		[=] Spikes will appear from the ground.
		
=> Fire :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Just stays on th ground and lights up in intervals
		[=] Might also light up in random intervals.
		
=> SpikedBall :
	(-) Animations :
		[=] Moves in an arc in to and fro motion.

													Spawn Combinations
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=> Can Spawn spike with rockhead at a smaller distance such as 2 for harder difficulties.
	[-] Spawning at more than 2 (i.e. 3) for now. The player will land directly on the spike if they dont jump at the correct distance.
